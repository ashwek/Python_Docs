# The Python Library Reference

Pythonâ€™s standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of facilities. The library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to system functionality such as file I/O, as well as modules written in Python that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming.

In addition to the standard library, there is a growing collection of several thousand components (from individual programs and modules to packages and entire application development frameworks), available from the Python Package Index.
