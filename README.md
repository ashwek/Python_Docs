# Python

## [The Python Language Reference](./The_Python_Language_Reference/README.md)

This reference manual describes the **syntax and core semantics** of the language. It is brief, but attempts to be exact and complete.

## [The Python Tutorial](./The_Python_Tutorial/README.md)

This tutorial **introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system**. This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, **it introduces many of Python’s most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language’s flavor and style**.
