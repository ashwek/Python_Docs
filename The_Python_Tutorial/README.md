# The Python Tutorial

Python is:
-  _dynamicaly_ & also _strongly_ typed language [_Explanation_](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Why%20is%20Python%20a%20dynamic%20language%20and%20also%20a%20strongly%20typed%20language)
- _interpreted_
- suitable as an _extension language_ for customizable applications

The **Python interpreter** & the extensive **standard library** are **freely available** in _source / binary form_ at [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/), & _may be freely distributed_. Here we introduce many of Python’s most noteworthy features, & will give you a good idea of the language’s flavor & style.

Python enables programs to be written compactly & readably. Python programs are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:
 - the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;
 - statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;
 - no variable or argument declarations are necessary.

**Python is extensible:** if you know how to program in C it is easy to add a new built-in function or module to the interpreter, either to perform critical operations at maximum speed, or to link Python programs to libraries that may only be available in binary form (such as a vendor-specific graphics library). Once you are really hooked, you can link the Python interpreter into an application written in C and use it as an extension or command language for that application.
